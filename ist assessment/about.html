		<h1>About us</h1>
		<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>This page was started by John Bradfield, a young entrepreneur from Las Vegas. This is the fastest growing electronics company in America and to cater to people in lockdown Tech Soup is going online.</p>
		<h2>What do we do?</h2>
		<p> If by now you still aren't sure Tech Soup is an electronics company. We sell things from ear buds to tvs to toasters to retro pop-corn makers. We have cheap prices and fun promotions and we'll ship it straight to your house unless you're not there for the 5 seconds the dude lnocks on your door. Good luck with that by the way :)</p>
		<h2>Contact us</h2>
		<p> You can contact us through our email johnsfieldsofbrad@gmail.com although we may not reply as we never check our email (Honestly wo does?). Or you can come into our home store at 2421, Tech Center CT, Las Vegas, NV 89128, United States ... </p>
